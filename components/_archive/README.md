# Archived Components

This directory contains outdated components, examples, and documentation.

## Directory Structure

### `examples/`

Demo and example files for learning purposes:

- `VehicleCard.example.tsx` - Example vehicle card implementation
- `VehicleCard.quickstart.tsx` - Quick start example
- `VehicleCard.README.md` - Component documentation example

### Root Archive

- `FEATURE7_SUMMARY.md` - Feature 7 implementation summary (completed)

## Current Active Components

For current, production-ready components, see:

- `../VehicleCard.tsx` - Active vehicle card component
- `../VehicleDetail.tsx` - Active vehicle detail component
- `../VehicleList.tsx` - Active vehicle list component
- `../CarImage.tsx` - Active image component with SSR support
- `../FilterBar.tsx` - Active filter bar component

## Why These Were Archived

- **Examples**: Demo files used for initial learning/prototyping. The actual implementations are now in the main components directory.
- **FEATURE7_SUMMARY**: Documentation for a completed feature, preserved for reference.

## Usage

These archived files can be referenced for:

- Understanding component evolution
- Quick start examples for new components
- Historical context for design decisions

They are not used in production and should not be imported in active code.
