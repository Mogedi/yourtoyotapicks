## üî¥ CRITICAL - Must Do Before Launch (Week 1)

### 1. **Connect to Production Supabase Database** ‚è±Ô∏è 2-3 hours

**Why First:** Can't have a real MVP with only mock data

**Tasks:**

- Create Supabase project at supabase.com
- Run database migrations (`lib/database/database.sql`)
- Add environment variables to `.env.local` and Vercel:
  ```
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_url
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_key
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_key
  ```
- Seed with initial real data (can use mock data structure)
- Test database connection and fallback logic
- Verify queries work in production

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] Supabase project created
- [ ] Database schema deployed
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] App connects successfully
- [ ] Mock data can be imported

---

### 2. **Deploy to Vercel** ‚è±Ô∏è 30 mins

**Why Second:** Get your app online immediately

**Tasks:**

- Connect GitHub repo to Vercel
- Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
- Configure build settings (should work automatically)
- Deploy and verify build succeeds
- Test live site with Supabase connection
- Set up custom domain (optional)

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] Site deployed to production URL
- [ ] Build succeeds without errors
- [ ] All environment variables configured
- [ ] Database connection works on live site
- [ ] All pages render correctly

---

### 3. **Set Up Basic Analytics** ‚è±Ô∏è 1 hour

**Why Third:** Track if anyone is using it

**Tasks:**

- Add Vercel Analytics (free, already integrated)
- OR add Google Analytics 4
- Track key events:
  - Page views
  - Dashboard visits
  - Vehicle detail clicks
  - Filter usage
- Set up conversion events (viewing vehicle details = success)

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] Analytics installed
- [ ] Tracking verified (test events show up)
- [ ] Key events configured
- [ ] Dashboard accessible

---

## üü° HIGH PRIORITY - Launch Week (Week 1-2)

---

## üí° Recommended Launch Plan

### This Week (10 hours total)

1. ‚úÖ Connect Supabase + Deploy to Vercel - ~4 hours
2. ‚úÖ Manually curate 20 real vehicles for your area - ~3 hours
3. ‚úÖ Improve landing page + add email capture - ~2 hours
4. ‚úÖ Share with friends + Reddit - ~1 hour

### Next Week (based on feedback)

5. Decide: Continue manual curation OR build API automation

---

## üö´ What NOT to Do Yet

‚ùå **Don't build automation until you validate people want this**

- Manual curation shows quality
- Faster to launch
- Easier to iterate

‚ùå **Don't add authentication (you're the only user)**

- Adds complexity
- Slows launch
- Not needed for validation

‚ùå **Don't worry about scaling (you won't have traffic issues)**

- Vercel scales automatically
- Supabase free tier handles thousands of users
- Mock data works fine for hundreds of users

‚ùå **Don't build email notifications until you have subscribers**

- Waste of time if nobody signs up
- Build it when you have 10+ subscribers

‚ùå **Don't spend time on fancy features**

- Validate core value first
- Add features based on user feedback
- Ship fast, iterate faster

## üé™ Launch Strategy

### Where to Share (ranked by expected ROI)

#### 1. Reddit (Highest ROI)

**Subreddits:**

- r/UsedCars (337K members)
- r/Toyota (89K members)
- r/Honda (52K members)
- r/PersonalFinance (18M members)
- r/Frugal (1.5M members)

**Post Template:**

```
Title: I got tired of wasting hours on CarGurus, so I built a curator for used car shopping

Body:
I was spending 10+ hours per week browsing CarGurus, Autotrader, and Cars.com trying to find a reliable used Toyota/Honda. 90% of listings were junk - salvage titles, 5 owners, rental vehicles, etc.

So I built YourToyotaPicks - it only shows clean-title, 1-2 owner vehicles and scores them on 6 quality factors. No more wading through garbage listings.

Right now it's just for Toyota/Honda in [your area], but I'd love feedback on the UX and scoring algorithm.

[your-url]

Not monetized, no ads, just trying to solve my own problem. What do you think?
```

#### 2. HackerNews (High Visibility)

**Post as "Show HN"**

**Title:** "Show HN: I built a curator for used car shopping (filtering out junk listings)"

**Template:**

```
I spent way too much time browsing used car sites, so I automated the filtering process.

YourToyotaPicks only shows:
- Clean titles only (no salvage/rebuilt)
- 1-2 owners max
- Zero accidents
- Below-market pricing
- Reasonable mileage for year

Each vehicle gets a quality score based on 6 factors. The UI is designed to show you the best matches first, with clear explanations why.

Currently curating Toyota/Honda vehicles, but the approach could work for any make.

Tech stack: Next.js 15, Supabase, Vercel, TypeScript

Would love feedback on the scoring algorithm and UX!

[your-url]
```

#### 3. Twitter/X (Medium ROI)

**Hashtags:** #UsedCars #CarShopping #Toyota #Honda #CarBuying

**Tweet Template:**

```
I was frustrated by how much time I wasted on CarGurus filtering through junk listings.

So I built an automated curator that only shows top-tier picks:
‚úÖ Clean titles
‚úÖ 1-2 owners
‚úÖ Zero accidents
‚úÖ Quality scored

Check it out: [your-url]

[screenshot of dashboard]
```

#### 4. ProductHunt (Launch After Traction)

- Wait until you have 10+ users and testimonials
- Prepare high-quality screenshots
- Write compelling launch post
- Schedule for Tuesday-Thursday (highest traffic)

#### 5. Your Personal Network (Immediate)

**Reach out to:**

- Friends currently shopping for cars
- People who bought cars recently
- Car enthusiast groups
- Local community groups

**Message Template:**

```
Hey! I know you were/are shopping for a used car. I built a tool that might help - it filters out all the junk listings (salvage titles, rental vehicles, etc.) and only shows quality picks.

Would love your feedback if you have 5 minutes: [your-url]

Not trying to sell anything, just validating if this is useful!
```
