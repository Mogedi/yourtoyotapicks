## Why Archived?

These documents provided immense value during development but are now historical. They were moved to archive to:

1. **Reduce clutter** in the main `/docs` folder
2. **Preserve history** for future reference
3. **Focus attention** on current active documentation

## When to Reference

Refer to these documents when:

- Understanding **why** certain architectural decisions were made
- Researching **how** complex features were implemented
- Learning from **lessons learned** during refactoring
- Onboarding new developers to understand project evolution
