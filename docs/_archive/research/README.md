# Research Documentation Archive

This folder contains research and analysis documents that informed project decisions. All research documented here has been **completed and decisions have been implemented**.

## Purpose

These documents capture research, analysis, and decision-making processes that shaped the project's technical direction. They are archived because the research is complete and the recommendations have been adopted.

## Contents

### Tools and Setup Research

- **`TOOLS_SETUP_SUMMARY.md`** - Comprehensive research on development tools, testing frameworks, and automation setup
  - **Key Decisions**: Puppeteer for E2E testing, automated error detection system, git workflow enhancements
  - **Status**: All recommendations implemented

### Code Quality Research

- **`CODE_REVIEW_REFACTORING_SUGGESTIONS.md`** - In-depth analysis of codebase quality and refactoring opportunities
  - **Key Findings**: Component architecture improvements, service layer patterns, type safety enhancements
  - **Status**: Refactoring completed in October 2025

### Constants and Configuration Research

- **`CONSTANTS_CONSOLIDATION_RESEARCH.md`** - Research on when to consolidate constants vs. keeping them inline
  - **Key Decision**: Keep single-use UI strings inline, extract only reused values
  - **Rationale**: Industry best practices, Tailwind design tokens, DRY principles
  - **Status**: Decision adopted across codebase

## Research Outcomes

All research in this archive led to concrete implementations:

✅ **Tools Setup** → Automated error detection system, E2E test suite
✅ **Code Review** → Component refactoring, service layer architecture
✅ **Constants Strategy** → Documented approach in CLAUDE.md and CURRENT_OPEN_ISSUES.md

## Why Archived?

Research documents are archived when:

1. **Research is complete** - No open questions remain
2. **Decisions are made** - Clear path forward chosen
3. **Implementations are done** - Recommendations are in production
4. **Documentation exists elsewhere** - Decisions captured in active docs

## When to Reference

Refer to these documents when:

- Understanding **why** certain technical approaches were chosen
- Researching **alternative approaches** that were considered
- Evaluating **trade-offs** for similar future decisions
- Conducting **code reviews** to ensure consistency with past decisions

## Active Documentation

For current research and decisions, see:

- **`/docs/architecture/`** - Current architectural decision records
- **`/docs/development/`** - Active development guides
- **`/CURRENT_OPEN_ISSUES.md`** - Current technical decisions and workarounds
- **`/CLAUDE.md`** - Project principles and conventions
