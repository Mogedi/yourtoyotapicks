- `MARKETCHECK_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Early implementation plan
- `MARKETCHECK_QUICK_START.md` - Quick start guide (outdated)
- `MARKETCHECK_READY_TO_IMPORT.md` - Import readiness assessment

**Status**: Integration complete, moved to completed/ folder

### `completed/`

- `DASHBOARD_V2_FEEDBACK.md` - Feedback on sub-agent approach (too complex)

## Current Active Documentation

For up-to-date feature documentation, see:
- [`../DASHBOARD_V2_SIMPLIFIED.md`](../DASHBOARD_V2_SIMPLIFIED.md) - ‚≠ê **Active** - Table view implementation plan
- [`../DASHBOARD_V2_README.md`](../DASHBOARD_V2_README.md) - Quick reference for Dashboard V2

## Why These Were Archived

- **Iterations**: Multiple planning documents were created during the Marketcheck integration exploration phase. The final comprehensive plan supersedes all earlier iterations.
- **Completed**: Feature is done and documented in the main codebase/docs.
- **Planned**: Features moved to future phases (Phase 3+) and may be revisited later.
