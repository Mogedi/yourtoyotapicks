## ðŸ“¦ To Get Full Functionality (Optional)

### Option 1: Use Mock Data (Current - No Setup Needed)
âœ… **Already working!**
- 32 sample vehicles
- All features work except persistence
- Perfect for testing and demo

### Option 2: Set Up Supabase Database (15 minutes)

**Step 1: Create Supabase Account**
1. Go to https://supabase.com
2. Sign up (free tier)
3. Create new project: "yourtoyotapicks"
4. Wait 2 minutes for setup

**Step 2: Run Database Schema**
1. In Supabase dashboard, go to SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `lib/database.sql`
3. Paste and run
4. Verify tables created in Table Editor

**Step 3: Update Environment Variables**
1. In Supabase: Settings â†’ API
2. Copy your URL and anon key
3. Edit `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_actual_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_actual_key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
   ```
4. Restart dev server: Stop (Ctrl+C) and run `npm run dev`
